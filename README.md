This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization using Power BI. The aim is to provide HR managers and decision-makers with clear insights into factors contributing to attrition, enabling data-driven workforce management strategies.

ðŸ”§ Key Steps Performed

Data Cleaning & Preparation
----------------------------

Handled missing values and removed inconsistencies.

Standardized categorical variables for consistency (e.g., departments, education levels).

Created new calculated columns and measures to derive deeper insights.

Modeling & DAX Implementation
--------------------------------

Created measure for attrition rate.

Built calculated columns for age group segmentation, salary bands, and education categories.

Exploratory Analysis
----------------------

Examined employee attrition patterns across key dimensions:

Departments (Sales, HR, R&D, etc.)

Salary Levels (Low, Medium, High)

Education Level

Age Groups

Dashboard Development
------------------------

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

Attrition trends & key metrics (overall attrition rate, department-wise attrition).

Filters & slicers for department, salary, age, and education.

Visualizations for comparing attrition across demographic and job-related factors.

ðŸ“Š Insights Gained
----------------------

Identified high attrition rates in specific departments.

Observed that employees with lower salary bands showed higher turnover.

Found age and education level significantly influenced attrition patterns.
